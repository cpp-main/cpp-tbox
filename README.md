**C++ Treasure Box** is a service-oriented **development framework** and **component library** based on the Reactor model, aim at make C++ development easy.

# Application field

- **Intelligent hardware**, such as: robots (sweepers, commercial service robots), IPC, drones, vehicles, etc.;
- **Edge computing components**, such as: smart home gateway, IOT edge gateway, etc.;
- **Service**, such as: SOCK5, Middleware.

See projects:

- [cpp-socks5](https://github.com/cpp-main/cpp-socks5), learn how to use TCP and how to organize the project;
- [protocal-adapter](https://github.com/cpp-main/protocal-adapter), learn how to use TCP, UDP, MQTT, UART;
- [cpp-tbox-for-ros](https://github.com/cpp-main/cpp-tbox-for-ros), learn how to how to integrate into the ROS 2 development environment, and how to use `rclcpp`;

# Features

## 1. Based on the Reactor
See the Node.js Reactor pattern.  
The main thread handles non-blocking IO events in Reactor mode, and cooperates with ThreadPool to perform large calculations and blocking operations.  
![](documents/images/0001-tbox-loop.jpg)  
This mode avoids the annoyance of competing locking in multi-thread mode, and the program is stable and reliable.  

## 2. Contains main framework, easy to use
All non-business-related work is handled using the built-in main framework. You don't need to care about such trivial things as how to output the log, how to parse the parameters, how to exit the program, and how to write the main function. The main frame is all handled for you.  
You only need to derive the `tbox::main::Module` class, fill in the business code, and then register to the framework.

## 3. With Shell-like terminal
You can interact with the running service through telnet, make it print internal data, or perform specific actions. This greatly reduces the difficulty of debugging.    
![shell interaction](documents/images/0000-terminal-show.gif)  

## 4. With completely log system
**1) There are three log sink: stdout + filelog + syslog**  

- stdout，Output the log to the terminal via `std::cout`;
- syslog，Output logs to syslog via `syslog()`;
- filelog，Write the log to the specified directory, in the format: `<PRIFIX>.YYMMDD_HHMMSS.<PID>.log`. If the file size exceeds 1M, a new log file will be created. Due to the low efficiency of writing files, the output channel adopts the front-end and back-end modes.

One or more of the three sink can be selected in the startup parameters, and can also be changed through the terminal during operation.

**2) Different level different color**  
The log content includes: level, time (accurate to microseconds), thread number, module name, function name, text, file name, line number.  
It is convenient and quick to locate the problem. 
![log show](documents/images/0002-log-show.png)  
As shown in the figure above, different log levels are clearly distinguished by colors. In particular, for anomalies, red and yellow are used together with highlighting, making them very eye-catching.

**3) Flexible log output filter**  
The log level can be set separately for different modules when the program is running, as follows:  
![set log level](documents/images/0001-set-log-level.gif)  

## 5. Flexible parameter system
Parameters are provided in JSON format, and any format of running parameters can be passed in, including: integers, decimals, strings, arrays, and combination parameters, meeting almost all parameter passing requirements:  
![paremeter help](documents/images/0005-arguments.png)  
You can use `-c your_cfg_file.json` to import a configuration file in JSON format at execution time. At the same time, you can also use `-s 'xx.yy.zz=vvv'` to specify parameters temporarily.  
The configuration file in JSON format also supports the include command to include other configuration files when loading.  

## 6. Assign tasks across threads without locking
The child thread entrusts the main thread to execute:  
![runInLoop example](documents/images/0003-run-in-loop.png)  
The main thread entrusts the child thread to execute:  
![ThreadPool example](documents/images/0004-run-thread-pool.png)  

## 7. Graceful exit process
When receiving signals: SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGPWR, it will execute the exit process in an orderly manner and release resources. Do a clean exit.  
![graceful exit](documents/images/0002-exit-friendly.gif)   
This is crucial for ensuring program integrity and conducting memory analysis.  

## 8. Comprehensive exception capture mechanism
When various program exceptions occur in the program, such as: segment fault, assertion, bus error, exception not caught, etc., the framework will capture and print the complete call stack in the log system. Facing program crashes, no longer look blank. The effect is as follows:  
![stack print](documents/images/0006-error-dump.png)  
With this mechanism in place, analyzing program crash issues of online devices becomes very simple, and there is basically no need to use gdb to analyze coredumps.  

## 9. Visualized trace module
The trace module can record the time and duration of each execution of the marked function, and can export the icicle diagram for display:  
![icicle diagram](documents/images/0011-trace-view.png)  
It is a great tool for performance analysis and event blocking problem troubleshooting. 

## 10. Simple and visualized state machine
It abandons the cumbersome inheritance and derivation of the traditional state mode, and uses it directly in a combined way, which is simple and convenient. It can also export the state machine diagram to achieve what you see is what you get:  
![visualized state machine](documents/images/0010-state-machine-graph.png)  

## 11. Visualized behavior tree
It contains an event-driven behavior tree that can realize sequential, branching, and cyclic action processes in an asynchronous environment, and can export a visual tree diagram in real time:  
![visualized behavior tree](documents/images/0010-action-tree-graph.jpg)

Of course, you can also specify the generation path of header files and library files by specifying `STAGING_DIR`.  
like:  
```
make 3rd-party modules RELEASE=1 STAGING_DIR=$HOME/.tbox
```
After completion, the header files and library files are in the $HOME/.tbox path.  

## Using CMake
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```
Customize the installation directory by specifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (installed in /usr/local by default):  
```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.tbox
```
